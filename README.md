Git is a command-line and is an open-sourcedÂ version control.

GitHub is a service that allows users to host and save  Git repositories online. GitHub has social networking tools that make collaborating on projects much more efficient.

 Repository, sometimes called  repo, refers to a location people store their files for a project they are working.   Each project has a district repository that can be accessed through its url.

Clone  refers to a copy of a repository that is saved on a computer instead of a server associated to the website.

Commit refers to a quick glimpse or a snapshot of your repo which allows the user to look back at any changes that were made, whether if the changes was made by you or a collaborator on the project.  It's basically a history of all the changes made.

Push refers to the transfer, of the changes you made, from your git repo to a remote git repo.  GitHub is an example of a remote git repo.

Pull, also known as a pull request, allows you to tell other partners on the project you are working on about any changes you made that was pushed over to repo GitHub.
Changes made can also be reviewed and also modified and merged with the parent repo. 

Branches refer to how you can move back and forth between 'states' of a project.

Merge, or a git merge, refers to merging when you want to merge a branch, or more than one branch, into your branch.

A merge conflict refers to when there is a change in one file that conflicts with a change made in another file.   As a result you will have to manually go in git and tell it which version to use, you can do this by using the Git mergeTool to resolve merge conflicts.

Fetch refers to getting the newest changes in GitHub without merging them and you can compare these changes to your local branches.

Remote refers to the repository created in GitHub.  It shows all the remote versions of your repository.
